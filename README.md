# Assignment 4: Heap Data Structures – Implementation, Analysis, and Applications

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains Python implementations and analysis for the following data structure topics:

- ✅ Heapsort algorithm using max-heap
- ✅ Priority Queue with task scheduling simulation
- ✅ Time complexity analysis
- ✅ Empirical comparison with Quicksort and Mergesort

The assignment demonstrates how heaps can be used for efficient sorting and task scheduling in real-world applications.
